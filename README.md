# Template_API

This readme can be used not just a reference for the template but also goes into details for how the user authentication works and why it is configured the way it is. It is very important to note that this all comes from a great youtube series from [Edutechnical HTTPS session cookies](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgYiyoyNPrv_yNp5Pzsx0A3gQ8-tfg66j).

## Configuration

### Ruby version

2.6.1

### System defaults

- localhost port 3001 set within
  - \_api/config/initializers/cors.rb-ln7
  - \_api/config/puma.rb-ln13

#### Session Cookies for User Auth

- CORS setup with broad range of methods, can be customized per application's needs. File can be found here (\_api/config/initializers/cors.rb)

---

### Database topology

#### User Model

- Used for user authentication

**User Model Creation**

```shellscript
rails g model User username email password_digest
```

> This generates a User model with a username, email and password; digest works with bcrypt and built in rails functionality to encrypt the string provided as the password.

---

**user.rb**

```ruby
  ...
  has_secure_password

  validates_presence_of :username, :email
  validates_uniqueness_of :username, :email
  ...
```

> Default configuration is to force a unique username and email for each user that registers.

---

**current_user_concern.rb**

This module creates a before action to be used universally that sets the current user to the user stored in sessions; allowing front-end pages to check the current user when needed.

```ruby
...
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    before_action :set_current_user
  end

  def set_current_user
    if session[:user_id]
      @current_user = User.find(session[:user_id])
    end
  end
...
```

**sessions_controller.rb**

Controlls user session creation, logging in and logging out.

```ruby
...
  include CurrentUserConcern

  def create
    user = User
      .find_by(username: params["user"]["username"])
      .try(:authenticate, params["user"]["password"])

    if user
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      render json: {
        status: :created,
        logged_in: true,
        user: user,
      }
    else
      render json: { status: 401 }
    end
  end

  def logged_in
    if @current_user
      render json: {
        logged_in: true,
        user: @current_user,
      }
    else
      render json: {
        logged_in: false,
      }
    end
  end

  def logout
    reset_session
    render json: { status: 200, logged_out: true }
  end
...
```

**registrations_controller.rb**

Handles the creation of a user account.

```ruby
...
  def create
    user = User.create!(
      username: params["user"]["username"],
      email: params["user"]["email"],
      password: params["user"]["password"],
      password_confirmation: params["user"]["password_confirmation"],
    )

    if user
      session[:user_id] = user.id
      render json: {
        status: :created,
        user: user,
      }
    else
      render json: { status: 500 }
    end
  end
...
```

#### API Endpoints / Routes

**routes**

```ruby
  # Create a User session
  # Create a new User via registration
  resources :sessions, only: [:create]
  resources :registrations, only: [:create]

  # Log a user out
  # Check to make sure a user is logged in
  # this is used when moving in the app
  # to check the user remains logged in
  delete :logout, to: "sessions#logout"
  get :logged_in, to: "sessions#logged_in"

  # Static page at root of api to make sure
  # server is running
  root to: "static#home"
```

> Creates an endpoint at the root of the server

---

**static_controller.rb**

```ruby
def home
  render json: { status: "It's working" }
end
```

> Render json status.

---

**application_controller.rb**

```ruby
...
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token
...
```

> Makes sure authentication token is being checked all the time.

### Forgotten password

### Database initialization

`rails db:create` is all that is needed to create the initial databases. By default this will create a deveolpment and test database.

## Deployment

## Testing

### Sessions Testing

In Terminal,

1. Start rails server (per template config it will run on port 3001)
2. New Terminal Tab type the following:

```shellscript
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data '{"user":{"username":"ronkilav", "email":"ronkilav@email.com","password":"asdfasdf"}}' \
http://localhost:3001/sessions
```

> It is just easier to type this in Terminal than to try to test api with an application like Postman or Insomnia. The backslash is just to allow multiple lines in Terminal.

Server response if configuration is correct:

```shellscript
{"status":"created",
"logged_in":true,
"user":{"id":1,"username":"ronkilav","email":"ronkilav@email.com",
"password_digest":"$2a$12$Fj6ZBybAM15mNdQYeuSzceiKXwH5Knl0VTNmfuU9BxQzyY9yBnncK",
"created_at":"2020-05-19T20:45:58.288Z",
"updated_at":"2020-05-19T20:45:58.288Z"}}
[16:06:22]
```

> Output is actually on a single line, I placed it on multiple lines for readablity.
